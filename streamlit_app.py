                ‚Ä¢ Upload your PDF (research) document you want to chat with.
                
                ‚Ä¢ Select the PDF you want to chat with from the dropdown.
                
                ‚Ä¢ Type your query and click "Ask your question" to obtain a response from the LLM.
                
                Tips:
                
                ‚Ä¢ The LLM has access to wikipedia, a calculator and your PDF document.
                
                ‚Ä¢ If the LLM fails to respond, guide it by telling it what tool to use. Use a phrase like "You MUST do research"
                
                ‚Ä¢ Try to frame your queries as questions.
                
                ‚Ä¢ Avoid using punctuation marks at end of sentences. For some reason, it can mess up the LLM.
                
                ‚Ä¢ Avoid queries that require multi-step reasoning or multi-step tool usage.        
                
                ‚Ä¢ If you still want multi-step/tool reasoning try appending the following phrase at the end of your query:
                "You MUST think step-by-step"
                
                """
